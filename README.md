# On-the-Contractivity-of-Plug-and-Play-Operators

#### This repository contains codes for the SPL paper: On the Contractivity of Plug-and-Play Operators
---

This repository is solving linear inverse problems in image processing. At its core, a linear inverse problem aims to reconstruct an image that might contain corrupted or unobserved pixels. Our repository provides solutions for three primary reconstruction techniques:

1. **Image Inpainting**: In this scenario, a subset of the image's pixels is unobserved. The challenge is to reconstruct the entire image, including these unobserved pixels.
   
2. **Superresolution**: Here, the input is a downscaled version of the original image. The goal is to reconstruct the image back to its original resolution.
   
3. **Deblurring (Uniform and Gaussian)**: The objective of this method is to counteract the blur effect in an image, bringing back its original clarity and sharpness.

A cornerstone of the reconstruction methodology is the PnP-ISTA (Plug-and-play Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm). ISTA due to Beck and Teboulle[^beck2009fast^] and ADMM by Boyd et.al [^admm^] as iterative algorithms for image reconstructions. Sreehari et al.[^sreehari2016plug^] showed using a powerful denoiser for ISTA/ADMM, i.e. PnP-ISTA/PnP-ADMM, are particularly effective for reconstructions. In our implementation, we've adopted the Non-Local Means denoiser (NLM) denoiser in PnP-ISTA/PnP-ADMM to get the reconstructions. These codes are for :
- Image reconstruction and computes the iterates of ISTA and ADMM.

- The contractivity of relevant operators, symbolized as \(P\) and \(R\) (as detailed in our paper).
   
- Changing to different initializations converges to the same reconstruction in both ISTA and ADMM.

## üéØ Running the Main Script

The `main.py` script is the primary entry point to run the demo. You can customize the execution using various command-line arguments.
This script serves as the primary interface to run the demo. You can easily tailor the execution by leveraging various command-line arguments.

### üõ† Arguments:

- `--image_path`:

  **Default**: `'images/'`
  
- `--output_path`:  
  Determines the folder where the processed results will be deposited.  
  **Default**: `'results/'`
  
- `--image_num`:  
  Choose which image to process. Accepts numbers 1 through 16.  
  1-14: Standard images commonly employed in image processing.  
  15: A uniform image where all pixels are of 0.5 intensity.  
  16: A Gaussian image generated with parameters \( \mathcal{N}(0.5, 0.5) \).  
  **Default**: `1`
  
- `--initialization`:  
  The method used for algorithm initialization. Options are:  
  - `'median'`: Uses median filtering on the observed image to initialize.
  - `'zero'`: Initializes with an image where all pixels are set to 0.
  - `'ones'`: Initializes with an image where all pixels are set to 1.

```

## üõ† Helper Scripts

This section provides a brief overview of the helper scripts included in the repository:

1. **config.py**:  
   Contains configurations required to run the demo and other scripts.

2. **forward_models.py**:  
   Implements various forward models:
   - Inpainting
   - Deblurring:
     - Uniform
     - Gaussian
   - Superresolution

3. **iterative_algorithms.py**:  
   Contains the implementations of:
   - ISTA
   - ADMM

4. **denoisers/NLM.py**:  
   This script implements the Non-Local Means (NLM) denoising method. It includes two denoiser functions:

- `DSG_NLM`: The symmetric NLM version[^sreehari2016plug^].
- `NLM`: The standard Non-Local Means denoiser[^buades^].

Both implementations can take images directly as input and produce the denoised image as output.


5. **contractive_factor.py**:   
The `contractive_factor.py` module houses the necessary code to compute the largest singular values of operators $` \mathbf{P} `$ and $` \mathbf{R} `$ (refer to the paper)  using the power method.

    Function: `power_method_for_images`
   
    Parameters:
      
      - `f`: The operator implemented as a function for which the spectral norm is being computed.
      - `args_dict`: A dictionary containing arguments to the operator `f`.
      - `input_image`: Any image that has the same shape as the input to the operator `f`.
      
      This function starts by initializing a random image with the same shape as the provided `input_image`. It then applies the power method to ascertain the spectral norm of the operator given by `f`.
      
      The function is instrumental in determining the contraction factor of the operator $` \mathbf{P} `$ where:
      $`
       \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{W}(\mathbf{I}-\gamma \mathbf{A}^\top\!  \mathbf{A})
      `$
      
      and the operator $` \mathbf{R} `$, defined as:
      
      $` \mathbf{R} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{J}), \qquad \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{F}\mathbf{V} , \qquad
       \mathbf{F} = 2(\mathbf{I} + \rho \mathbf{A}^\top\mathbf{A} )^{-1} - \mathbf{I}, \qquad \mathbf{V} = (2\mathbf{W}-\mathbf{I})
      `$
      
      Note: When the denoiser is `DSG_NLM`, the standard spectral norm is used for computations. However, when the denoiser is `NLM`, the $` \|.\|_{D} `$ norm is employed.

      
      For the calculation of the $` ||.||_2 `$ norm or $` ||.||_D `$ norm of the operators $`  \mathbf{P} `$ and $`  \mathbf{R} `$, there we need:
      
      - Forward Operator $`  \mathbf{A} `$: implemented as an operator on an image
      
      - Step Size: $` \gamma `$ for PnP-ISTA and $` \rho `$ for PnP-ADMM.
      
      - Denoiser $` \mathbf{W} `$: which takes the noisy image, NLM parameters, and a guide image as input:
         - The `noisy_image`.
         - The parameters for the Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm.
         - A `guide_image` to help the denoising process.
      
      **Note**: During the repeated application of the denoiser in the power method updates, we utilize the `original_image` as the `guide_image`. The power method itself starts with a randomly initialized          image to perform its updates.
